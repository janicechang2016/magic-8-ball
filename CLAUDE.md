# Magic 8 — "my dumbass boyfriend magic 8 ball" — Project Context

A Magic 8 Ball web app: **classic black plastic 8-ball look + snarky Y2K voice + Mean Girls magazine spread background**. Responsive web app → installable PWA → eventually a **physical ball with an embedded round screen**.

**Two sides of one ball:** the default side is *her* snark ("my dumbass boyfriend magic 8 ball"); a second **"boyfriend rehab"** side (calm-blue theme) gives the boyfriend emotionally-intelligent **"say this, not that"** scripts. They're the same single page — a `#rehab` URL hash + a `body.rehab` theme class — and you move between them by **flipping the ball over** (reusing the wake turn-over as the transition). See "Two sides / theme system" below.

## Current state

### What it looks like
- **Background:** the actual scanned Y2K teen-magazine spread (`magazine-inspo.webp`) painted full-bleed on its own `#bg-photo` layer (`cover`, sized to `100lvh`), with a soft cream tint + radial vignette layered on top via `body::before`.
- **Masthead:** "my dumbass boyfriend magic 8 ball" in Shrikhand with hot-pink fill + deep-ink stroke. Small (13px) **Bodoni Moda italic** pink-pill kicker reads "send his dumbass to the stratosphere girl <3". (Both masthead + kicker are theme-swapped per side — see `THEMES`.) **Type note:** the "scrapbook marker" surfaces (kicker, `ask in words` pill, swipe caption, desktop side-link, shake toast) were moved off Permanent Marker onto **Bodoni Moda italic** to match the answer/input type.
- **Stickers (decor):** `100% ACCURATE*` badge, `so kawaii~~` tag, butterfly/heart emoji **decals (moved up into the top band — ~14% / 30% — so they clear the lower half)**, `*results may vary` cream-paper sticker (positioned high on mobile via `.rmv` media query to clear the touch UI stack).
- **Orb:** glossy **black** `MeshPhysicalMaterial` (#0e0e0e, clearcoat 1.0). Neutral warm lights instead of the original candy multi-hue.
- **Window (the "center feature"):** an **HTML overlay** centered on the viewport — circular white-to-cream div with a bold black serif "8" (Bodoni Moda 900). A **recessed-window ridge** (`#answer-overlay::after`) draws a beveled rim — highlight along the top edge, shadow along the bottom — masked to a thin ring near the circle's edge, plus a 2px dark groove via box-shadow, so the window reads as sunk into the ball like a real 8-ball. On `.waking` and `.answering`, the bg transitions to deep navy (#0a1340 → #02041a) and the "8" fades out. The dark-navy inverted-triangle clip-path element scales/fades in (no rotation), and luminescent white answer text staggers in on top.
- **Bottom UI:** cream paper `#hint` label (only renders when non-empty), italic Bodoni question input with the ritual-framing placeholder `spill it… the orb decides ♥` (signals the typed text doesn't determine the answer). **On touch the input is hidden behind a dashed "✎ ask in words" pill** (`#ask-words`, Bodoni italic) — tapping it reveals + focuses the field (`body.typing`). The input also **shares one slot with the hint**: a `#ui:has(#hint:not(:empty)) #question` rule hides the field whenever the hint carries text, so they never stack. Italic pink **ASK** button (**desktop only** — hidden on touch via `@media (pointer: coarse)`), small cream **"↺ ask again"** button (rounded pill + drop-shadow + icon so it reads as a control rather than a sticker) that resets to the input state — labeled "Enable motion" on iOS until motion permission is granted.

### What it does
- Tap/click orb, click ASK (desktop), or press Enter in the input → `ask()`. On touch, **tap vs. horizontal swipe on the orb are disambiguated by drag distance** in a `pointerdown`/`pointerup` pair (`>55px` and mostly-horizontal = flip sides; otherwise = `ask()`).
- iOS DeviceMotion shake (`magnitude > 18`, 1.2s cooldown) also fires `ask()`. Permission gated via the "Enable motion" button on iOS 13+; on grant, the button rewires into a **Reset** that snaps the ball back to its landing state.
- On non-iOS, motion is auto-registered and the **Reset** button shows immediately.
- **Shake hint toast (`#shake-toast`):** a one-time Y2K pink sticker ("psst — shake your phone bestie 🤳") floats just above the input/button stack on **mobile only**. It's shown via `showShakeToast()` *only once motion is actually live* — immediately on Android, after the iOS permission grant — so it never tells the user to shake before shaking works. `dismissShakeToast()` (called at the top of `ask()`) fades it out on the first shake/tap/Enter and it does not return. Gated by `isTouch = matchMedia('(pointer: coarse)')` + `toastShown`/`toastDismissed` flags.
- The typed question doesn't affect the answer (random from the active set — `ANSWERS` or `REHAB`) — it's pure ritual.

### Accessibility & resilience
- **Zoom is allowed** — the viewport meta no longer sets `maximum-scale`/`user-scalable=no` (WCAG 1.4.4).
- **Keyboard focus ring:** a `:focus-visible` outline (3px `var(--ink)`) on ASK, ask-again, the pill, side-link, swipe caption, and the pager dots. The input keeps its own border+glow focus style.
- **Real input label:** `<label class="sr-only" for="question">` (not placeholder-as-label); `.sr-only` is the standard visually-hidden utility.
- **Pager dots** keep their 10px look but get a ~26px tap target via a transparent `.pdot::after` (WCAG 2.5.8).
- **No-WebGL / no-CDN fallback (`has3D`):** Three.js init is wrapped in try/catch. On failure → `body.no3d`, the **`#orb-fallback` CSS sphere** stands in for the orb (it also doubles as a **loading skeleton** while the CDN script fetches — hidden by `body.has3d` once 3D is live), and `ask()`/`flipSide()` run on **timers** (`fbWake`/`fbDone`) instead of the render loop so the ball still answers. Pointer events bind to `#scene` (`mount`), not the canvas, so taps work in both modes.
- **Still open (not addressed this pass):** #1 the answer is `aria-hidden` with no `aria-live` region (screen readers get silence); #3 no `prefers-reduced-motion` (the 360° tumble + infinite caption/toast animations); #6 the active side isn't exposed to AT (`.pdot.on` is visual only).

### Locked content
- **21 custom snarky answers** in `ANSWERS` (block 1, default side). Keep the deranged-but-affectionate voice.
- **12 "say this, not that" pairs** in `REHAB` (block 1b, rehab side) — `{bad, good}`. Only `good` is shown (the EQ rewrite). Sincere-but-cheeky; keep them short enough to fit the triangle.
- **Per-side wake line** (`THEMES[mode].wake`, single each — don't randomize): default `consulting my extremely worn thin patience…`; rehab `buffering emotional intelligence…` (both trail off with the `…` ellipsis glyph).
- **Per-side post-reveal hint** (`THEMES[mode].hint`): default `it has spoken ♥`; rehab `character development ♥`.
- **Per-side title / masthead** (`THEMES[mode].title`): default `my dumbass boyfriend magic 8 ball`; rehab `house-training my chungus boyfriend magic 8 ball`. The **home-screen / PWA name** stays `my dumbass boyfriend magic 8 ball` (manifest + meta, not theme-swapped).
- **Per-side kicker / stickers / link** also live in `THEMES` (block 1b): default kicker "send his dumbass to the stratosphere girl <3", stickers `100% ACCURATE*` / `so kawaii~~` / `*results may vary`, link "send his dumbass to rehab →"; rehab kicker "teaching his dumbass to communicate <3", stickers `*put him in his place!` / `growth king~~` / `*progress not guaranteed`, link "← ugh, lost cause".

## Two sides / theme system (the "boyfriend rehab" foil)

- **Concept:** Page 1 (default) = her catharsis, snark verdicts, hot-pink Y2K. Page 2 (`#rehab`) = his redemption arc, **"say this, not that"** EQ scripts, calm-blue "rehab" theme. Same black ball, flipped over.
- **One document, two modes.** Not a second HTML file (that would duplicate the whole Three.js engine and break the flip). A `body.rehab` class swaps CSS variables + `body::before` wash + masthead stroke; JS swaps text + the active answer set.
- **`THEMES` config (block 1b)** holds per-side `title / kicker / badge / tag / rmv / link / linkHref / wake / hint`. `applyTheme(m)` writes those into the masthead, kicker, three stickers, and `#side-link`, and points `activeAnswers` at `ANSWERS` (default) or `REHAB` (rehab), plus sets `currentWake` / `currentHint` (read by `ask()` and the loop).
- **`REHAB` (block 1b)** is an array of `{bad, good}` pairs. **Only the `good` (EQ rewrite) line is displayed** — the struck-through `bad` instinct + arrow were removed per design; `bad` is retained in the data in case it's wanted back. `showRehabAnswer()` streams `good` via the shared `streamChars()` glow helper, then `fitAnswerToTriangle()`. `revealPending()` dispatches: object → rehab renderer, string → `showAnswerHTML()`.
- **Flip control is responsive:** desktop keeps the `#side-link` bookmark **tab on the right edge** (`position:fixed`). On touch, `#side-link` is **hidden** and replaced by a **`#pager`** at the foot of the `#ui` stack: a **directional caption** (`#swipe-hint`, reusing the per-side `THEMES.link` copy + arrow, Bodoni italic, with a gentle `swipe-nudge` rock) above **two `.pdot` dots** (filled dot = current side). You flip by **swiping horizontally across the ball**, tapping a dot, or tapping the caption.
- **The flip (block 7b + `S.FLIPPING`):** every affordance (desktop `#side-link`, the swipe gesture, the `.pdot` dots, the `#swipe-hint` caption) just sets `location.hash` (`#rehab`/`#home`) → `hashchange` → `flipSide(mode)`. `flipSide` runs the same -360° turn-over as WAKING; at the **midpoint (p≥0.5, backface hidden)** it calls `applyTheme(pendingMode)` so the swap is unseen, then lands on IDLE (the "8" window) on the new side. `applyTheme` also repaints the `.pdot` filled state + the `#swipe-hint` copy. `modeFromHash()` + the initial `applyTheme(modeFromHash())` make each side a real shareable URL with working back/forward.
- **Rehab visual:** `body.rehab` retints to calm blues (`--hot:#2f7fd6` etc.), a cool `body::before` wash, deep-blue masthead stroke, and `body.rehab #answer-overlay .tri` uses tighter padding (`8% 5% 0`) so rehab cards start higher in the wide top of the triangle. The black orb, the **"8" idle window** (kept, not a heart), and the blue answer triangle are unchanged (shared by both sides). The magazine **photo is the same** — only the wash recolors the mood (no second bg image).

## Architecture — the big pivot

The original `magic8ball-y2k.html` rendered the bezel / glass / idle 8 / answer plate as flat `CanvasTexture` planes inside the 3D scene. **All of that has been deleted.** The window is now an HTML overlay (`#answer-overlay`) centered on the viewport, and the 3D scene is just the shell sphere + lights + charm sprites.

**Why:** the user wanted CSS keyframe-based reveals (per-char blur+brightness), a 3D "turn over" rotation effect, luminescent text, and a Reset action — all far easier in HTML/CSS/DOM than canvas/Three.js.

**Trade-off:** the HTML overlay is fixed at viewport center. It does NOT live on the orb's surface. To sell the illusion that it's part of the ball:
- During WAKING, the overlay's `transform` is synced to the orb's projected pixel position (via `pxPerWorld`) so it slides with the orb's rock.
- The overlay's `transform` also picks up a CSS 3D `rotateX` mirrored from `orb.rotation.x` — because the orb is a featureless sphere, the **only visible "turn over" is this overlay rotation**. The orb is rotating in 3D but you can't see it.
- `backface-visibility: hidden` on the overlay hides it once it flips past ~90°, so the ball appears to "turn the other way" mid-shake.
- At REVEAL the inline transform is cleared so the overlay snaps back to dead-center for the triangle pop-in.

## Animation timeline

```
ask() ──► state=WAKING ──── 1500ms ────► state=REVEAL ──── 3800ms ────► state=IDLE
          orb does -360° X tumble                          triangle pop-in + char        hint flips to
          overlay mirrors rotateX +                        stagger reveal                "it has spoken ♥"
          translate by orb pos × pxPerWorld                bg transitions stay
          backface-visibility hides mid-flip               (dark navy from waking)
          bg cream→navy via .waking class
```

### WAKING (1500ms) — the "turn over"
- **One** -360° X-axis rotation with ease-out: `orb.rotation.x = -2π · (1 - (1-p)^2.6)`. Power 2.6 = quick whip forward, slow settle.
- Subtle organic rock: two near-but-different sin waves on x/y position (freq 7.5 / 6.8, amp 0.045 / 0.055, damped by `1-p` so it lands still).
- Overlay tracks orb position in screen px AND mirrors `orb.rotation.x` as CSS rotateX with `perspective(700px)`. With `backface-visibility:hidden`, the window vanishes past ~90° and reappears past ~270°.
- The `.waking` CSS class drives the white→navy bg transition and fades the "8" out.

### REVEAL (3800ms) — the answer
- Triangle (`.tri`) pops in via `triangle-flip` keyframes: 550ms, **scale .65 → 1, opacity 0 → 1** (no rotation — used to also flip in rotateX, but that read as a second turn-over and was removed).
- **3D facet look (lighting only, no transform):** `.tri` is a beveled rim (directional gradient, lit top → dark point); `.tri::before` is a raised inner facet (inset clip-path triangle) with a top specular highlight; `.tri::after` pools a core shadow toward the point. `.ans` is `position:relative; z-index:2` to sit above both pseudo-layers. Kept transform-free on purpose so it doesn't reintroduce the double-turn-over.
- Char-by-char stream: each `.char` span animates `char-reveal` — opacity 0→1, filter `blur(14px) brightness(2.5)` → `blur(0) brightness(1)` — 600ms cubic-bezier(.2,.7,.3,1). Stagger 80ms per char, **base delay 360ms** so chars start streaming as the triangle settles.
- **Font auto-scale by length:** `showAnswerHTML` reads `text.length` and sets a `--ans-scale` CSS variable consumed by the `.ans` font-size. Buckets: ≤12→1.0, ≤20→.88, ≤28→.76, ≤36→.66, longer→.58.

- **Per-side hint:** at REVEAL end the hint flips to `currentHint` (`THEMES[mode].hint`), not a hardcoded string.
- **Rehab font fit:** `showRehabAnswer()` sets a length-based starting `--ans-scale`, then `fitAnswerToTriangle()` caps the text to a safe inscribed box near the wide top of the inverted triangle (`maxWidth ≈ 56% of tri width`, `maxH ≈ 34% of tri height`) and steps the scale down until it fits — so even long answers never clip on a 150px mobile window. Default answers keep the simple length-bucket scale in `showAnswerHTML` (no fit pass).

### FLIPPING (1500ms) — switching sides
- Triggered by `flipSide(targetMode)` (via the swipe gesture / `.pdot` dots / `#swipe-hint` caption / desktop `#side-link` → hash → `hashchange`). Same -360° X turn-over math as WAKING, but it does **not** reveal an answer.
- At the **midpoint (p≥0.5, backface hidden)** it calls `applyTheme(pendingMode)` once (`flipSwapped` guard) so the theme/masthead/sticker swap happens unseen, then lands on IDLE (the "8" window) on the new side.

### Reset
- The Reset button (formerly "Enable motion") clears everything: state→IDLE, asked=false, pending='', orb transform reset, overlay class→`.idle`, answer chars/hint/question input all cleared. Lands the user back at the white "8" window.

## Code map (blocks inside `index.html`)

| # | Block | Notes |
|---|-------|-------|
| 1 | Answers | `ANSWERS` (21) + `WAKE_LINES` (legacy single, unused) — what ports to firmware |
| 1b | Rehab content + themes | `REHAB` (12 `{bad,good}` pairs) + `THEMES` config (per-side title/kicker/badge/tag/rmv/link/linkHref/wake/hint) |
| 2 | Scene | camera (FOV 38°; **portrait z is computed to fit the orb to the narrow horizontal axis**, landscape z=4.2), `WebGLRenderer({alpha:true})` wrapped in try/catch → **`has3D` flag**; on failure the whole 3D path is skipped (see Accessibility & resilience). |
| 3 | Lights | neutral warm (ambient + key + 2 fills) — toned down for the black plastic |
| 4 | Shell | black `MeshPhysicalMaterial` (#0e0e0e, clearcoat 1.0). One mesh, that's it. |
| 5 | Answer window — HTML overlay handles. `setOverlay()` toggles `idle / waking / answering`; `showAnswerHTML()` (default, length-bucket scale) + `streamChars()` + `showRehabAnswer()` (rehab, calls `fitAnswerToTriangle()`) + `revealPending()` dispatcher. |
| 6 | Charms | floating heart/star/sparkle sprites. ALL positioned at `bz` between -1.6 and -3.4 (behind orb's back face). The orbital `charms.rotation.y` was removed so sprites never rotate around into z > 0 (i.e., in front of the orb). |
| 7 | State machine | `IDLE / WAKING / REVEAL / FLIPPING`. `ask()` uses `activeAnswers`/`currentWake`; every ASK does the same -360° X tumble with mirrored CSS rotateX on the overlay. |
| 7b | Themes + side flip | `applyTheme(m)` (also repaints `.pdot` + `#swipe-hint`), `flipSide(targetMode)`, `modeFromHash()` + `hashchange`. Touch flip = swipe-on-orb (pointerdown/up drag test) / `.pdot` dots / `#swipe-hint` caption; desktop = `#side-link`. All set `location.hash`. |
| 8 | Device motion + reset + shake toast | shake detection + iOS permission. `reset()` and `becomeResetButton()` rewire the motion button into a Reset action after grant (or immediately on non-iOS). `showShakeToast()`/`dismissShakeToast()` drive the mobile-only `#shake-toast` hint, fired when motion goes live and cleared on first `ask()`. |
| 9 | Render loop | wake math + FLIPPING branch (midpoint theme swap), per-side hint flip, `revealPending()` at WAKING→REVEAL |
| 10 | Resize | recomputes `pxPerWorld = h / (2 · camera.z · tan(vFov/2))` for shake-tracking |
| 11 | Answer overlay JS | (lives in block 5 region) `setOverlay`, `showAnswerHTML`, `streamChars`, `showRehabAnswer`, `fitAnswerToTriangle`, `revealPending` |
| 12 | PWA | `navigator.serviceWorker.register('./sw.js')` |

## CSS state classes on `#answer-overlay`

- `.idle` → white/cream bg, black "8" visible
- `.waking` → bg transitions to deep navy (#0a1340 → #02041a), "8" fades out
- `.answering` → bg stays navy, `.eight` hidden, `.tri` `display:flex` (triggers `triangle-flip` pop-in), `.ans` chars stream in

Background and box-shadow on `#answer-overlay` use a 500ms ease transition; both `.waking` and `.answering` share the same navy gradient so there's no flicker at the WAKING→REVEAL boundary.

---

## PWA caching strategy

- **HTML + manifest** → **network-first** (so copy/code iterations land on reload)
- **Icons + magazine photo + Three.js CDN** → **cache-first** (offline + perf)
- **Bump `VERSION` in `sw.js`** whenever SW logic changes (currently `magic8-v3`) so the activate handler purges old caches

---

## Mobile considerations

- **Portrait camera distance is derived from the *horizontal* FOV** (`z = 1.2 / (tan(vFov/2) · aspect)`) so a radius-1 orb is always fully contained left-to-right (no edge clipping on narrow phones); the orb ends up ~38% of viewport height. Landscape stays `z=4.2`. The answer-overlay window was enlarged to `clamp(185px,36vmin,290px)` (with bigger `.eight`/`.ans` font clamps) for legibility and still sits ~57% inside the portrait orb.
- **Background must NOT use `background-attachment: fixed`** — on iOS Safari that sizes the cover image to the layout viewport and leaves a white bar at the bottom. The photo is painted in **two places**: (1) a dedicated `#bg-photo` fixed layer (`z-index:0`, `width:100vw; height:100lvh`, `center/cover`) fills the in-viewport content area; (2) the **same image on the `html` root** (`center/cover`) — the browser propagates the root background across the whole canvas, including the iOS safe areas behind the status bar / home indicator, which a `position:fixed` layer does *not* cover. Page is `height:100dvh`; `html` keeps cream `var(--paper-warm)` as a load-failure fallback only.
- **iOS Safari chrome can't be painted by the page.** In a normal Safari *tab*, the top status bar and the bottom URL toolbar are browser UI — the root-bg trick fills behind the status bar, but the bottom URL bar stays. The genuinely edge-to-edge, no-chrome experience is the **installed PWA** (Add to Home Screen → standalone, where `viewport-fit=cover` + `apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style: black-translucent` let the photo go fully full-screen). This is also the intended iteration-3 form factor.
- `*results may vary` sticker has `.rmv` class with a media query bumping `bottom` from ~108px to **~210px** at ≤600px wide, to clear the touch UI stack (the "ask in words" pill + `#pager` + Reset). If you change the stack height, re-check this offset.
- Procedural magazine `.strip / .issue / .pgnum` fragments are hidden everywhere via `#mag-bg{display:none}` since the photo replaced them — but the CSS is retained for easy revert.
- Question input has `autocomplete="off"` and blurs itself on Enter so the iOS keyboard dismisses.
- **The ASK button is hidden on touch devices** (`@media (pointer: coarse){ #shake{display:none} }`) — on mobile you tap the orb or shake the phone. Desktop keeps the ASK button. On touch the **question input is also hidden behind the "✎ ask in words" pill**, and the **`#side-link` tab is replaced by the `#pager` (dots + swipe caption)** — both part of the mobile bottom-half declutter.
- **Top stickers must share the masthead's `env(safe-area-inset-top)` offset.** The masthead is offset by `env(safe-area-inset-top)`, so in standalone PWA (inset ≈ 59px) it drops below the notch. Any sticker pinned near the top with a flat `top:%` will NOT move with it and will collide (the `100% ACCURATE` badge overlapped the kicker pill until its top became `calc(18% + env(safe-area-inset-top))`). In Safari the inset is ~0 so this is a no-op there. If you add more top-anchored stickers, give them the same `+ env(safe-area-inset-top)`.
- On iOS, the Reset button text starts as "Enable motion" until the user grants permission; then the same button instance is rewired to call `reset()` with the label changed.
- The `#shake-toast` shake hint is **mobile-only and motion-gated** (only shown once `devicemotion` is registered), so it never appears on desktop and never prompts a shake before iOS permission is granted. Positioned `bottom:195px` to float above the input + button stack. One-time per page load — does not reappear on Reset.

## Gotchas / don't regress these

- **`Object3D.add()` returns the parent.** Never chain `.position.z = X` directly off `.add()` — it silently clobbers the parent's `position.z`. Always: assign mesh to a const, set `.position` on the const, then `group.add(mesh)`.
- **The HTML overlay is decoupled from the orb's 3D position by default.** The transform-sync in WAKING is what makes them move together AND what makes the "turn over" visible. If you add new states or rework the loop, make sure the overlay's inline transform is cleared when transitioning out of WAKING.
- **The visible "turn over" is the overlay rotation, not the orb's.** Don't rip out `orb.rotation.x` in WAKING — it's the source value being mirrored to CSS. But also know that the sphere rotating in 3D produces zero pixels of visible change on its own.
- **`position:absolute` inside a flex parent doesn't auto-center.** The blue triangle was visibly off-center for a release because of this. Use explicit `left:50%; transform:translateX(-50%)`.
- **Triangle must be inscribed in the circle.** With `width:82%` the top edge needs `top:25%` so the corners don't poke through the white circle. Reducing either changes both.
- **Triangle no longer rotates on reveal.** It used to do a rotateX flip in `triangle-flip`. That was perceived as a second turn-over on top of the wake's 360°. Now it's pop-in only (scale + fade). If you re-add a rotation here, watch for the double-flip feedback.
- **Three.js CDN URL** (`https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/three.js/r128/three.min.js`) is hard-coded in `sw.js` precache. If you swap CDNs/versions, update both.
- **Tap vs. swipe on the orb share one handler.** The orb's `pointerdown`/`pointerup` pair decides: a mostly-horizontal drag `>55px` flips sides, anything else fires `ask()`. If you rework orb input, keep that threshold or a stray flick will flip instead of asking (or vice-versa).
- **The hint/input slot-share relies on `:has()`** (`#ui:has(#hint:not(:empty)) #question`). Needs a `:has`-capable engine (Safari 15.4+ / modern Chrome). For older engines, replace it with a body-class toggle driven from the state machine. The mobile "ask in words" pill also clears the hint on tap so this rule lets the field show.
- **All Three.js is gated on `has3D`.** Anything touching `orb`/`scene`/`renderer`/`charms` must be inside an `if(has3D)` block or guarded — otherwise it throws in fallback mode and kills `ask()` too. The render loop + `resize()` only start when `has3D`; the no-3D path is driven by the `fbWake`/`fbDone` timers in `ask()`.
- **Portrait orb size is derived, not fixed.** `resize()` computes `camera.position.z` from the horizontal axis in portrait. Don't hard-code a portrait `z` back in or the orb clips on narrow screens. If you resize the answer-overlay window, re-check it still fits inside the (smaller) portrait orb.

1d. ~~UI/UX + a11y pass (audit items 2,4,5,7,8,9,10,11): zoom re-enabled, focus rings, dot tap targets, real input label, `has3D` no-WebGL/CDN fallback + loading skeleton, ritual placeholder, Reset → "↺ ask again", portrait orb containment + larger answer window~~ — **DONE (branch `a11y-ux-pass`).** Remaining a11y: #1 aria-live answer, #3 prefers-reduced-motion, #6 active-side state.
2. **Finish smoke test.** Desktop ✓ (default + rehab flip). Still TODO on a real phone: shake/motion (iOS permission, Android auto), confirm ASK hidden + shake toast, **the rehab flip both directions + `#rehab` deep-link + rehab answer legibility/fit**, PWA install (Add to Home Screen → standalone), offline (airplane-mode launch). **New touch interactions to verify:** swipe-to-flip vs tap-to-ask threshold feel, the "ask in words" pill reveal/collapse + iOS keyboard dismiss, dots/caption legibility over the photo.
3. **Open follow-ups flagged but not done:** (a) the flip's theme swap is **instant at the midpoint** — could add a crossfade if it reads abrupt; (b) the rehab **blue wash** is a tint over the same pink magazine photo — could push bluer or use a different bg if it doesn't read "calm" enough; (c) the mobile `#swipe-hint` caption + `.pdot` dots are white/hot text over a busy photo (relying on a text-shadow) — add a faint pill/backing behind them if they read faint on a real screen.
4. **Polish:** `navigator.vibrate()` is wired in `ask()` (and a `[15,30,15]` pattern in `flipSide()`); consider `prefers-reduced-motion` fallback (no flip / no wobble), loading state while Three.js CDN loads, optional echo of the typed question during reveal.
4. **Iteration 3 — physical ball:**
   - **MCU:** ESP32 (Wi-Fi, drives display, reads sensor)
   - **Display:** round IPS LCD (e.g. GC9A01 240×240) behind the window
   - **Sensor:** MPU-6050 / MPU-9250 accelerometer
   - **Two paths:** (a) ESP32 serves this HTML to an on-board display, or (b) port block 1 (answers) + the answer-overlay reveal logic to firmware (TFT_eSPI / LVGL). Reuse, don't rewrite.

## Conventions

- No build step. Three.js r128 from CDN.
- **Procedural by default**, with two committed binary exceptions: PWA icons and `magazine-inspo.webp`. Don't add more without the user asking.
- Preserve the **single round-window sphere** form factor at every stage.
- Bump `VERSION` in `sw.js` on SW changes.
- When adding meshes to a `THREE.Group`: assign to a const, set `.position` on the mesh, then `group.add(mesh)`. Never chain off `.add()`.
- When positioning absolute children inside a flex parent, set `left/right/top/bottom` explicitly — don't rely on the flex centering inheriting.
- Animation rule of thumb: don't stack two distinct rotation animations back-to-back (wake flip + triangle flip = "double turn"). Pick one rotation per phase.
